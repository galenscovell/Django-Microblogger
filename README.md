Django-Microblogger
===================

Blogging system built from the ground up with Django and PostgreSQL. 
Based on my previous Sinatra-Microblogger. I realized it could be done better and more fully with a more robust framework.

Planned Features:
* User login/logout authentication, individual profiles
* Creating, editing, and deleting posts featuring author, title, content, edit date/time, topic tags
* Comment section for each individual post with username, content, date/time
* Post 'like' count and comment upvoting/downvoting
* Flash notice/error/info/success messages
* Search bar: Search across all post titles and authors returning list of relevant content
* Tag cloud: Easily view frequency of topics across the site
* Heroku hosting
* Aesthetic appeal
